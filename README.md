✅ This project demonstrates how AWS native services can be integrated to build a simple but effective **security monitoring and alerting system**. It can be expanded into a foundation for **SIEM-style monitoring** in cloud environments.

## Secrets Manager
In AWS Secrets Manager > Secrets > Store a new secret, I select “Other type of secret.”  
I then entered the Key/Value pairs:  
- **Key:** “The Secret is”  
- **Value:** “I need 3 coffees a day to function.”
